        Intern | Etisalat Egypt by E&, Enterprise Security Department (2 months)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Gained hands-on experience with security incident analysis, penetration
        testing, and maintaining security infrastructure. Worked with tools like
        Kaspersky Endpoint Security, FortiGate firewall, and Cisco ISE NAC
        Solution.
      </p>

      <h3>Intern | Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) (6 months)</h3>
      <p>

    <section id="projects">
      <h2>Projects and Achievements</h2>
      <h3>
        Graduation Project: Reconstructing 3D Facial Models from Textual
        Descriptions
      </h3>
      <p>
        Awarded an A+ Grade and the 2023/2024 Computer Scientific Society prize
        for the best Capstone project. Worked on the Facial Shape Reconstruction
        Module, retraining the pre-trained Deep3D model, achieving high accuracy
        in 3D facial reconstructions. Integrated SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL for
        database management and ensured the security of data in transit and at
        rest using backend frameworks like Flask.
      </p>

      <h3>Network Classroom</h3>
      <p>
        Implemented an application where one computer acts as a teacher to
        multiple student computers. The teacher computer can display its screen
        to students, view student screens, and share files using socket
        programming, the Tkinter framework, and the FTP protocol.
      </p>

      <h3>Smart Dustbin</h3>
      <p>
        Developed a system that detects human gestures to automatically open the
        bin, measures the level of garbage, and notifies users when it is nearly
        full. The system monitors multiple dustbins and allows remote commands
        using ESP8266, ultrasonic sensors, a servo motor, and MQTT protocol with
        a web HTML GUI for efficient waste management.
      </p>

      <h3>Web Application Firewall (WAF) Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        Secured Nginx with ModSecurity on an Ubuntu VM to prevent web
        application attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting
        (XSS). Configured OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) for ModSecurity and tested
        the firewall's effectiveness in blocking malicious traffic.
